**S**mart**H**ome**I**ntegration**T**ech (**SHIT**) is a platform independent framework to integrate cheap (SHITty) sensors reliably into your smart-home. For this purpose it provides the following features:

* Scheduling
  * Ensure all sensors are read frequently and fairly
  * Classify sensors and data by their timely and reliability needs
* Connectivity
  * Temporary storage
  * Reliable communication
* Sensors
  * Data fusion
  * Filtering
  * Pre-processing
  * Aggregation
* Hardware abstraction
  * Provide an abstraction layer that can be implemented on many different platforms that provide the basic services needed
  * Watchdog
  * Reliable WiFi connection
  * Resource monitoring
* Configuration management
  * Allow to configure sensors dynamically with configuration files, vs. statically by code.
* Update management
  * Provide a mean to update the firmware on the fly
